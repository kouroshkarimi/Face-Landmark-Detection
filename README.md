# Face-Landmark-Detection
A face landmark detection project with trained model (68 points)
Before landmark detection you must detect faces. this make model more accurate.you can use any model for detection face and any model for detecting landmarks. you can download our
face landmark detection model by search ("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks"). this is a model with 68 point detection.
## Train Model?
you can train your own models with face detection datasets and face landmark datasets simply. to doing that:

### 1: download the datasets.
You can use wider_face dataset to detecting face and Helen dataset for your landmark detection.
### 2: determind your model architector.
We have too many archs for doing this. you can use popular archs in computer vision and customize them or use papers arhcs working on face detecting or face landmark detection or 
even you can use a simple CNN network! it work maybe not good but it works for a medium accuracy.
### 3: Train your models and save them (in keras or pytorch)
In keras you are more simple coding. even if you dont have academic education of deep learning you can learni keras simply but pytorch syntaxes is more academicly.you must have a 
good base knowledge about deep learning to work with pytorch.I can say that in academic university use pytroch too much.
### 4: use your trained models in your face landmark detection main project.
After train your models you can simple use them in main project and predict with them.
